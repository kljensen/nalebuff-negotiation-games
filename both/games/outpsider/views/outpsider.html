    Did Helen agree to share with Cade the cost of taking less than $2/share? In other words, if the purchase price was $460k, Cade and Helen would each take $1.60/share for a total of $80,000 each while the Artagis and the Friends/Angels were paid out at $2/share.

    In your case the expected payoffs were as follows:

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    {{#each roleOutcomes}}
      <dt>{{name}}</dt>
      <dd>
        {{>dollars amount=outcome format="0,0"}}

      The payoff to Pat was based on a valuation of the business at 5 times the cost savings&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;*&nbsp;$245,800&nbsp;=&nbsp;$1.229m. (This values the business absent any cost savings at zero.) We needed to put a value on the business to distinguish the payoff from a no deal ($0) and the payoff from hitting your limit $470,000, which still leads to a substantial positive payoff, in this case $1.229m&nbsp;-&nbsp;$470k&nbsp;=&nbsp;$759k. If Pat paid more
      than $470, Pat's payoff was reduced to -$250k for violating Pat's authority.
    </p>
  {{else}}
    <p>
      While no deal resulted in a 0 payoff to Pat, this is still better than the large negative payment that would have resulted had Pat exceeded his or her authority. Similarly, the fallback deal with Artagis at $1.60/share often leads to a higher payoff to Cade and Helen than a deal with Iceberg.
